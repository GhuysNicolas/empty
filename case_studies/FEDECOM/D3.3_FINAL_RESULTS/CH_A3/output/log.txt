
Presolve eliminates 926759 constraints and 597178 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 9;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
301630 variables, all linear
551917 constraints, all linear; 1813581 nonzeros
	377881 equality constraints
	174036 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.
