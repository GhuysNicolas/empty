
Presolve eliminates 1113060 constraints and 663129 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 11;" might work better.
Adjusted problem:
32423 variables, all linear
41603 constraints, all linear; 272997 nonzeros
	25543 equality constraints
	16060 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.

Setting $presolve_fixeps >= 3.87e-06 could change presolve results.
