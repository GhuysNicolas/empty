
Presolve eliminates 994060 constraints and 602425 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 11;" might work better.
Adjusted problem:
93127 variables, all linear
160603 constraints, all linear; 621168 nonzeros
	88535 equality constraints
	72068 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.

Setting $presolve_fixeps >= 3.87e-06 could change presolve results.
